ChatGPT and Artificial Intelligence in higher education: Quick start guide 5What is ChatGPT? 
ChatGPT is a language model that allows people to interact 
with a computer in a more natural and conversational way. GPT 
stands for “Generative Pre-trained Transformer” and is the name 
given to a family of natural language models developed by 
open Artificial Intelligence (AI). This is also known as a form of 
generative AI because of its ability to produce original results. 
ChatGPT uses natural language processing to learn from 
Internet data, providing users with artificial intelligence-based 
written answers to questions or prompts.
These models are trained on large text datasets to learn to 
predict the next word in a sentence and, from that, generate 
coherent and compelling human-like output in response to a 
question or statement. In the case of ChatGPT, 570gb of data 
representing 300 billion words have been supplied to the 
system and it has around 175 billion parameters.1
We can think about ChatGPT as a “computer robot” with 
whom you can talk about anything.2 This is helped by its user-
friendly interface. ChatGPT can be asked for data, analysis and 
even an opinion. However, the algorithm by which it works 
does not take a definite position, as its interpretation is based 
on the statistical analysis of billions of texts on the Internet.
This Quick Start Guide is based on GPT-3.5, the latest 
free version of ChatGPT available at the time of writing. 
Subsequent versions are expected to have more functionality 
including the capacity to interpret different types of data and 
with more advanced writing abilities.3
1    https://www.sciencefocus.com/future-technology/gpt-3/ 
2    Almost anything: ChatGPT has been trained to refuse inappropriate requests e.g., questions that violate someone’s rights, promote discrimination are 
offensive or deliberately seek to mislead. While robust, this training is not foolproof.

delete the chat.
5. To start a new query, click on ‘New chat’ or type into ‘Send a 
message’ underneath any existing query.We asked ChatGPT to explain 
ChatGPT in 50 words. Here is its 
answer:
ChatGPT is a large language model developed by 
OpenAI, based on the GPT-3.5 architecture. It can 
generate human-like text based on input prompts, 
answer questions, and perform a variety of natural 
language processing tasks. It was trained on a 
massive dataset of internet text to learn patterns 
and relationships in language.
ChatGPT and Artificial Intelligence in higher education: Quick start guide 6Important considerations when using 
ChatGPT
		To produce a more relevant result, provide ChatGPT with 
prompts about how you want it to respond.4 For example:
		Tell me how [add query] works in 50 words.
		Behave as/Act as a higher education manager. [Add 
query]
		Write a four-paragraph essay about [add query]
4     More examples of prompts can be found at Atlas, S. (2023) ‘ChatGPT for Higher Education and Professional Development: A Guide to Conversational 
AI’ , College of Business Faculty Publications [Preprint]. Available at: https://digitalcommons.uri.edu/cba_facpubs/548.
5     Flowchart devised by Aleksandr Tiulkanov, AI and Data Policy Lawyer, January 2023		If your query does not produce the intended result, try 
changing the prompt(s) and run the query again.
		Due to high demand, the free version of ChatGPT may be 
unavailable or run very slowly.
		Data used to train ChatGPT’s responses goes up to 2021. 
This means ChatGPT has no knowledge about anything 
that has happened or been created since 2021. However, 
some browsers that integrate ChatGPT do enable it to 
connect to more recent information.
		There is no way that ChatGPT can verify the information it 
provides or to assess its reliability. 
To ascertain the circumstances in which ChatGPT may be safe 
to use, follow this flowchart: 5

ChatGPT and Artificial Intelligence in higher education: Quick start guide 7Artificial intelligence 
ChatGPT is based on machine learning, which is currently 
the most popular technique in Artificial Intelligence (AI) 
technology. This section summarizes the different types of AI.
One way to understand AI is by classifying it by capabilities: 
Artificial Narrow Intelligence (ANI) and Artificial General 
Intelligence (AGI). ANI, or weak AI, is the type of AI that 
has been achieved so far. AGI, if ever reached, would be 
comparable to human intelligence.
ANI has two main functionalities: reactive machines and 
limited memory. Reactive machines are the primary type of 
AI that store memories or experiences. They solely react to a 
current scenario as they are taught one thing or task and are 
rarely applied to other scenarios. The most famous example of a 
reactive machine is IBM’s Deep Blue computer, which was able to 
play chess and beat international grandmaster Garry Kasparov.
Limited memory stores information for a short time and reacts 
to it. For example, autonomous vehicles or self-driving cars 
use the information of their surroundings and automatically 
make decisions such as stop or turn.
Machine learning is the currently the most popular technique 
of ANI and has seen significant progress in recent years. Rather 
than being programmed with rules to produce answers, 
computers receive data and the answers expected from the 
data and, as a result, produce rules by identifying patterns 
between the two. ChatGPT is based on machine learning.Other techniques of ANI include symbolic logic (also called 
inference engines or if-then models), expert systems, and 
knowledge graphs. Symbolic logic is most typically applied 
in chatbots, which determine the nature of a user’s problem 
through a series of closed questions, from where the chatbot 
may refer users to a human agent. Knowledge graphs are 
ways to connect and explain different concepts/data that are 
not based on machine learning. 
Figure 2: ChatGPT home screen
What is artificial intelligence (AI)?
As technology develops, so too do the ways we 
define it. There is no single or fixed definition of AI, 
but there is common agreement that machines 
based on AI “are potentially capable of imitating 
or even exceeding human cognitive capacities, 
including sensing, language interaction, reasoning 
and analysis, problem solving, and even creativity. ”

ChatGPT and Artificial Intelligence in higher education: Quick start guide 8Applications of ChatGPT in higher 
education 
Although still a recent development, ChatGPT has already 
been applied widely in different functions of higher 
education. This section outlines some possible uses of 
ChatGPT in teaching and learning, research, administration, 
and community engagement.Teaching and learning
Due to its ability to generate and assess information, ChatGPT 
can play a range of roles in teaching and learning processes. 
Together with other forms of AI, ChatGPT could improve 
the process and experience of learning for students. To do 
this, ChatGPT can be used as a standalone tool, or it can be 
integrated into other systems and platforms used by HEIs. 
ChatGPT can perform many simple or technical tasks (e.g., 
basic research, calculations, proofing) and the examples 
outlined in the table show how ChatGPT could be 
incorporated and used to augment teaching and learning.

ChatGPT can be used by researchers at different stages of the 
research process. This is summarized in figure 3.
ChatGPT has also been trialled in other processes relating 
to research, such as completing the technical parts of 
research grant applications (e.g., communications plans). An

aid in predicting whether a paper will be accepted.7 
ChatGPT has also been used to generate entire academic 
journal articles,8 opening an ethical debate about whether 
a non-human author can be considered a contributor to the 
creation of knowledge. At the time of writing this Quick Start 
Guide, no consensus had been reached. Some publishers 
have argued that ChatGPT cannot take responsibility for the Role6Description Example of implementation
Possibility engineAI generates alternative ways of 
expressing an ideaStudents write queries in ChatGPT and use the Regenerate response 
function to examine alternative responses.
Socratic opponentAI acts as an opponent to develop 
and argumentStudents enter prompts into ChatGPT following the structure of a 
conversation or debate. Teachers can ask students to use ChatGPT to 
prepare for discussions.
Collaboration coachAI helps groups to research and 
solve problems togetherWorking in groups, students use ChatGPT to find out information to 
complete tasks and assignments.
Guide on the sideAI acts as a guide to navigate 
physical and conceptual spacesTeachers use ChatGPT to generate content for classes/courses (e.g., 
discussion questions) and advice on how to support students in 
learning specific concepts. 
Personal tutorAI tutors each student and gives 
immediate feedback on progressChatGPT provides personalized feedback to students based on 
information provided by students or teachers (e.g., test scores).
Co-designerAI assists throughout the design 
processTeachers ask ChatGPT for ideas about designing or updating a 
curriculum (e.g., rubrics for assessment) and/or focus on specific 
goals (e.g., how to make the curriculum more accessible).
ExploratoriumAI provides tools to play with, 
explore and interpret dataTeachers provide basic information to students who write different 
queries in ChatGPT to find out more. ChatGPT can be used to support 
language learning.
Study buddyAI helps the student reflect on 
learning materialStudents explain their current level of understanding to ChatGPT and 
ask for ways to help them study the material. ChatGPT could also be 
used to help students prepare for other tasks (e.g., job interviews).
MotivatorAI offers games and challenges to 
extend learningTeachers or students ask ChatGPT for ideas about how to extend 
students’ learning after providing a summary of the current level of 
knowledge (e.g., quizzes, exercises). 
Dynamic assessorAI provides educators with a 
profile of each student’s current 
knowledgeStudents interact with ChatGPT in a tutorial-type dialogue and 
then ask ChatGPT to produce a summary of their current state of 
knowledge to share with their teacher/for assessment.

author, whereas others accept its role as co-creator.9
Administration
ChatGPT’s main role in supporting higher education 
institutions’ (HEI) administration has been in improving the 
efficiency of processes. In this way, ChatGPT can reduce 
human administrative time spent on tasks such as:
	Responding to queries from applicants (potential students)
	Helping students to sign up for courses, complete course 
requirements, check administrative information (e.g., exam 
timetables, location of classes)
	Finding news, resources, and other information
	Sending reminders or notifications 
	Translation of information for international students/staff
With the use of ChatGPT, administrative services can be 
available 24/7 and can be supported across different 
platforms. As well as integration into websites, it can also 
be used with social media, messaging services and learning 
management systems/virtual campuses. When interacting

10     At the time of writing, ChatGPT is blocked in China, Iran, Italy, North Korea, and Russia. It is unavailable in 32 other countries. See also: https://www.
bbc.com/news/technology-65139406 and https://www.wepc.com/tips/what-countries-is-chat-gpt-unavailable/. with ChatGPT, the style is more conversational, creating a 
more personalized experience.
Community engagement
HEIs can also use ChatGPT to develop sound strategies for 
community engagement. Considering their own specific 
characteristics (geography, location, community needs, local 
demographics), ChatGPT could be asked to develop targeted 
strategies to improve the wellbeing of the overall community. 
Based on those strategies, they could develop communication 
campaigns geared to the community and with a specific call 
to action. 
Challenges and ethical 
implications
The impact of ChatGPT on higher education has been 
immediate and divisive. Although its applications in higher 
education are extensive, many universities have already 
banned it over fears of student plagiarism, and several 
countries have blocked ChatGPT.10 This section distils the 
main challenges and ethical implications of ChatGPT in higher 
education. 
Figure 3: Possible uses of ChatGPT in the research process
Image created by UNESCO IESALC
ChatGPT and Artificial Intelligence in higher education: Quick start guide 11Academic integrity
The main concern that has been expressed about ChatGPT 
in higher education relates to academic integrity.11 HEIs and 
educators have sounded alarm bells about the increased risk 
of plagiarism and cheating if students use ChatGPT to prepare 
or write essays and exams. This may have deeper implications 
for subjects that rely more on written inputs or information 
recall, areas that ChatGPT can better support.
There are also concerns that existing tools to detect 
plagiarism may not be effective in the face of writing done 
by ChatGPT. This has already led to the development of other 
applications that can detect whether AI has been used in 
writing. In the meantime, multiple HEIs around the world have 
banned ChatGPT due to concerns around academic integrity 
and others have updated or changed the way they do 
assessments, basing them instead on in-class or non-written 
assignments.
Lack of regulation
ChatGPT is not currently regulated, a concern addressed by 
the UNESCO Recommendation on the Ethics of AI  (see next 
section). The extremely rapid development of ChatGPT has 
caused apprehension for many, leading a group of over 1,000 
academics and private sector leaders to publish an open letter 
calling for a pause on the development of training powerful 
AI systems.12 This cessation would allow time for potential 
risks to be investigated and better understood and for shared 
protocols to be developed.
Privacy concerns
In April 2023, Italy became the first country to block ChatGPT 
due to privacy related concerns.13 The country’s data 
protection authority said that there was no legal basis for 
the collection and storage of personal data used to train 
ChatGPT. The authority also raised ethical concerns around 
the tool’s inability to determine a user’s age, meaning minors 
may be exposed to age-inappropriate responses. This 
example highlights wider issues relating to what data is being 
collected, by whom, and how it is applied in AI.

unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000377182; https://oecd.ai/en/wonk/closing-the-gender-gap Cognitive bias
It is important to note that ChatGPT is not governed by 
ethical principles and cannot distinguish between right and 
wrong, true and false. This tool only collects information from 
the databases and texts it processes on the internet, so it 
also learns any cognitive bias found in that information. It is 
therefore essential to critically analyse the results it provides 
and compare them with other sources of information.
Gender and diversity
Concerns about gender and other forms of discrimination are 
not unique to ChatGPT but to all forms of AI.14 On the one 
hand, this reflects the lack of female participation in subjects 
related to AI and in research/development on AI and on 
the other hand, the power of generative AI to produce and 
disseminate content that discriminates or reinforces gendered 
and other stereotypes.15
Accessibility
There are two main concerns around the accessibility of 
ChatGPT. The first is the lack of availability of the tool in 
some countries due to government regulations, censorship, 
or other restrictions on the internet. The second concern 
relates to broader issues of access and equity in terms of the 
uneven distribution of internet availability, cost and speed. 
In connection, teaching and research/development on AI 
has also not been evenly spread around the world, with 
some regions far less likely to have been able to develop  
knowledge or resources on this topic.
Commercialization
ChatGPT was created by a private company, OpenAI. Whilst 
the company has pledged to maintain a free version of 
ChatGPT, it has launched a subscription option (currently 
US$20/month) that offers greater reliability and faster access 
to new versions of the tool. The involvement of private 
entities in higher education is not new and calls for care 
and regulation if selecting AI and other tools that are run by 
companies dependent on making profit, may not be open 
source (and therefore more equitable and available), and 
which may be extracting data for commercial purposes.
ChatGPT and Artificial Intelligence in higher education: Quick start guide 12UNESCO Recommendation  
on the Ethics of AI
The UNESCO Recommendation on the Ethics of AI aims 
to provide a foundation so that AI systems work for the 
betterment not only of individuals and societies but also 
for the good of the environment and ecosystems. The 
Recommendation is also designed to prevent harm from or 
by AI. 
Recognizing that AI has both positive and negative effects, 
the Recommendation was adopted in late 2021 with the 
expectation that governments would adopt it at national level 
and that other public and private sector actors would benefit 
from the ethical guidance provided by the Recommendation.
UNESCO has also published guidance for policymakers 
on AI and education . It outlines emerging practices in 
education and discusses the challenges of using AI to achieve 
Sustainable Development Goal 4  (Quality Education).
This will be accompanied later in 2023 by a Manual on AI in 
Higher Education to be published by UNESCO IESALC. This 
is believed to be the first globally comprehensive guide for higher education stakeholders on AI, targeting particularly 
those contexts where AI has been less widespread.
Actioning the UNESCO Recommendation
Harnessing the rapid spread of AI to ensure it supports the 
greater good should go hand in hand with the implementation 
of the UNESCO Recommendation on the Ethics of AI.
The UNESCO guidance for policymakers on AI and education 
sets out policy recommendations in seven areas:
1. A system-wide vision and strategic priorities
2. Overarching principle for AI and education policies
3. Interdisciplinary planning and inter-sectoral governance
4. Policies and regulations for equitable, inclusive, and ethical 
use of AI
5. Master plans for using AI in education management, 
teaching, learning, and assessment
6. Pilot testing, monitoring and evaluation, and building an 
evidence base
7. Fostering local AI innovations for education
The forthcoming UNESCO IESALC Manual on AI in Higher 
Education will include recommendations on implementing 
AI in line with the ethical principles set out in the UNESCO 
Recommendation and tailored guidance for higher education 
stakeholders on adapting the UNESCO guidance on AI and 
education.

ChatGPT and Artificial Intelligence in higher education: Quick start guide 13Adapting to ChatGPT in your 
higher education institution
Used ethically and with due consideration of the need to build 
individual and institutional capacity, ChatGPT could support 
HEIs to provide students with a more personalized and relevant 
learning experience, make administrative processes more 
efficient, and advance research and community engagement.
Use ChatGPT with care and creativity
While some states and HEIs have blocked ChatGPT, most 
governments and HEIs are seeking ways to adjust to a world 
in which AI has become more widespread, accessible, and 
easy to use. In that sense, ChatGPT can be used but requires 
both care and creativity to ensure it is handled ethically and 
appropriately. 
Suggested ways forward include:16
		Create opportunities for faculty, staff, students, and other 
stakeholders to discuss the impact of ChatGPT on the 
HEI and co-construct strategies to adapt and adopt to AI. 
The section below on conducting an AI audit offers one 
route for this type of engagement.
		Introduce clear guidance for students and instructors 
about how and when ChatGPT can be used (and when 
it cannot). Such guidance should be negotiated with 
students and teachers, not imposed on them. 
		Connect the use of ChatGPT to course learning 
outcomes. This helps students understand how ChatGPT 
can support their learning and what expectations there 
are for them.
		Review all forms of assessment and evaluation to 
ensure that each element is fit for purpose. This review 
may lead to replacing exams or other assessments with 
in-person assessments or altering the types of questions 
or exam formats that are used.
		Review and update policies relating to academic 
integrity/honesty in relation to ChatGPT and other AI 
tools.17
		Train teachers, researchers, and students to improve 
the queries they pose to ChatGPT. As researchers have 
noted, ChatGPT is most useful when the inputs provided 
to it are carefully created.18
16     Some of these suggestions are adapted from existing guidance already issued by HEIs. For example: http://www.rochester.edu/college/honesty/

17     See for example: https://conecta.tec.mx/es/noticias/nacional/institucion/tec-de-monterrey-recomienda-su-comunidad-uso-inteligente-de-chatgpt 
18     https://www.timeshighereducation.com/depth/chatgpt-revolution-academic-research-has-begun Build capacity to understand and 
manage ChatGPT
Adjusting to higher education in the era of ChatGPT also 
demands that HEIs pay attention to their role in building 
capacity to understand and to manage ChatGPT and AI. This 
must be balanced by the understanding that, at least for now, 
ChatGPT cannot replace human creativity and critical thinking 
and it is on these strengths that higher education has flourished.
New programmes/courses that focus on ChatGPT/AI will 
increase research and development capacity and provide 
students with cutting edge knowledge.
Existing programmes/courses can be updated to 
incorporate teaching of:
		AI literacy – as part of an expanded understanding of 
digital literacy and skills
		AI ethics
		Core AI competencies and skills
Training for staff can ensure that the support they provide 
to students and other stakeholders builds on rather than 
replicating what chatbots/AI tools offer and increase 
confidence in the deployment of technology.
Peer support and mentoring for faculty members to increase 
skill level and share good practices for teaching and ways of 
using ChatGPT in research can be done within faculties, at 
institutional level, or among supra-institutional communities 
of knowledge.
UNESCO IESALC will be offering an interactive version of this 
Quick Start Guide through Campus IESALC, a social and 
collaborative learning community. A longer course on AI 
and higher education is also envisaged. These courses are 
designed to strengthen competencies in the use of ChatGPT 
and other forms of AI in higher education.
ChatGPT and Artificial Intelligence in higher education: Quick start guide 14Conduct an AI audit
Regardless of whether ChatGPT and other forms of AI are 
already being used in your HEI, conducting an AI audit19 is an 
important step that will help assess the current situation and 
support institutional planning. 
It is suggested that this audit is undertaken by the HEI’s 
governing body following extensive consultation with all 
academic, administrative and IT departments as well as with 
students. HEIs may consider additionally consulting with their 
key stakeholders such as members of the local community, 
research partners, and students’ families.
1. Understand the current situation
		What is data-driven AI?
		How can digital technology support this HEI’s functions?
		If the technology is based on AI: 
		What data does it collect? 
		How does its data processing work?
		At institutional level, what relevant policies or regulations 
currently exist?
		On the use of AI
		On privacy and data protection
		On related areas (e.g., plagiarism, safeguarding)
		What external policies or regulations does the HEI need to 
account for (e.g., from government or research funders)?
		Which types of AI are currently being used in this HEI? 
		In which functions or units?
		Do all stakeholders (faculty, staff, students) have access 
to these tools? 
		How is training and support provided?
19     This audit has been adapted with permission from the AI Audit in Education developed by Priscila Gonsales (Co-founder and Director of 
Educadigital and Researcher at the UNESCO Chair in Open and Distance Education, University of Brasília, Brazil).2. Decide which AI to use
		Which areas could benefit from using AI? (e.g., student 
services, assessment, research)
		Which AI technology could be chosen?
		What would be the criteria for choosing?
		What value does the technology add?
		How would data be protected?
		What is the HEI’s position on open source/access vs 
commercial AI tools?
		How can the HEI ensure accessibility factors are 
considered?
3. Monitor performance and equity
		How effective is the AI technology in meeting the need 
that was identified?
		What criteria are used to measure effectiveness? 
		Can the data collected be used by the HEI?
		How can it be used?
		How often is data collected?
		To what extent is the AI technology overcoming or 
addressing equity concerns?
		How is this measured?
